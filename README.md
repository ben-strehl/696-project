# CSE 696 Project
A Unity game designed to teach players the basics of programming in Python

## Design
- In-game text editor to allow the player to write and run Python programs
- Built-in interpreter so that the game is standalone and not reliant on an existing Python installation
- The player is provided with an API to send commands to the game server over a local TCP socket
