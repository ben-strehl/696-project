# As you can see, this level has the same goal as the previous one.
# Like last time, we will make our 'ingredients' variable.
ingredients = ["Chocolate", "Frosting", "Sugar", "Flour", "Egg", "Milk"]

# This time, instead of using add_Custom(), we will
# practice using loops and 'if' statements.
# Type the following:
# for ingredient in ingredients:
#     if ingredient == "Chocolate":
#         add_Chocolate()
#     elif ingredient == "Frosting":
#         add_Frosting()
#     elif ingredient == "Sugar":
#         add_Sugar()
#     elif ingredient == "Flour":
#         add_Flour()
#     elif ingredient == "Egg":
#         add_Egg()
#     elif ingredient == "Milk":
#         add_Milk()

# We are using a 'for' loop again, like in
# Level 3.
# This time, we are using to go through every
# item in the 'ingredients' variable.
# We use a series of 'if' statements to check
# each ingredient.
# 'if' statements are used to run code only if
# the specified condition is true.
# ingredient == "Chocolate" is a condition that is only true
# if the value of the 'ingredient' variable is "Chocolate".
# 'elif' is short for 'else if' and elif statements only get
# checked if the statements before them were false, otherwise
# they simply don't get run.
