# Welcome!
# This game will teach the basics of the Python 
# programming language.
# Lines preceded by '#' are comments; they are ignored.
# Comments are useful for leaving notes for yourself
# in code.
# Here, we will use them as instructions.

# The goal for this level is to produce one egg.
#To do this, just type 'add_Egg()' on the line below this.
