# In this level, we will make our first cake.
# We will need to add all of the ingredients and then
# the robot will combine them on its own.

# Type 'add_Egg()', 'add_Flour()', 'add_Sugar()',
# 'add_Milk()', and 'add_Frosting()'.

# Each must be typed on their own separate line.
# The order is important! If you add the frosting first
# the robot will get confused and think you're trying
# to make chocolate frosting.

# 'add_Egg()', 'add_Flour()', etc. are functions.
# Functions are a way for programmers to define
# logic that can be used later.
# We will create our own functions later on.
