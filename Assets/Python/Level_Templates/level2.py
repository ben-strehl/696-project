# In this level, we will make our first cake.
# We will need to add all of the ingredients and then
# the robot will combine them on its own.

# Type  'add_Frosting()', 'add_Egg()', 'add_Flour()',
# 'add_Sugar()', and 'add_Milk()'. 

# Each must be typed on their own separate line.

# 'add_Egg()', 'add_Flour()', etc. are functions.
# Functions are a way for programmers to define
# logic that can be used later.
# We will create our own functions later on.
