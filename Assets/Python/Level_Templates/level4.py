# For this level, we will use a list.
# Lists in Python are like lists in real life - a group
# of values in order.
# Lists are created using square brackets - [].
# For example, a list of numbers looks like:
number_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Each item in the list is separated by a comma.

# Our list will contain strings. You can of strings a just text.
# We create a string in Python using quotes - "".
# For example, "Hello, World!" is a string.
hello = "Hello, World!"
# We will use strings to represent our ingredients and 
# put them together in a list.
# We will store that list in a variable.
# A variable is a name we use to refer to some information.

# Type: ingredients = ["Chocolate", "Frosting", "Sugar", "Flour", "Egg", "Milk"]

# 'ingredients' is the variable name. We can use it to 
# access our list.
# Note that the ingredient names are case-sensitive.
# The first letter must be capitalized.

# Now type: add_Custom(ingredients)

# add_Custom() is function, just like range() or add_Egg().
# We are passing our 'ingredients' variable as an argument.
